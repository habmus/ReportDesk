**Library ReportDesk Website**


The goal of this project is to provide a digital method of recording, saving, and reporting on the library’s staff interactions with patrons, commonly known as usage statistics. Currently, the University of North Texas at Dallas University Library keeps records of these interactions manually with a mix of physical paper and digital spreadsheets. This system will improve this process in a few key ways. First, it will centralize the usage statistics, making them easy to save and view. The system will also help ensure the integrity of the data as it is collected by using fixed data fields and metadata. Next, it will automate the reporting process, limiting possible errors and providing more historical data in a single snapshot view. Lastly, it will cut down on paper waste and physical storage required by paper documents.

The authors of this project wish to provide the UNTD University Library with a system that will help them more accurately and efficiently collect data about the services they provide to their patrons. This project is motivated by fulfilling this real and functional need of the UNTD University Library. By developing this system, the authors wish to enable the UNTD University Library to make more precise data-driven decisions. Working with a client with genuine requirements, the authors of this project hope to simulate, as closely as possible, what a real-world software design project would entail. In working in such an environment, the authors hope to both demonstrate and hone the core skills of any software developer: communication and logical problem-solving, while also providing an organization with tangible value.

**System Requirements**

1. Every single member (administrator/staff) shall have their own account which they can use to sign in to their account. On the login page, every user will be faced with two text fields. One for username and the other for their password. After their credentials are inputted, they will be sent to the database for verification.
If the user’s username or password does not match with the ones saved in our database, ”Incorrect Username/Password” will be output to the user.
As soon as verification is successful, the user will be taken straight to the homepage of our system which is the records page.

2. Below the Password field in the login page, there should be a link that says, “Forgot password?”. When that link is clicked, it should take the user to a page with a text box where they will have to input their username or email address so that their account can be searched. The email will be sent to the back-end of our system to check and see if it matches with any email present.
If the account is not found, the user shall get a message saying “Email Address not found, please contact your administrator” but if that is not the case, a unique password reset link should be sent to the mailbox of the account associated with the username entered earlier. The link sent to the user’s email should direct them to a page where they must reset their password with the required length and character combination. If the password rules – 8 characters long, must have numbers, must have at least one upper- and lower-case letter and one special character. are not met, the user shall get the message “Please follow the rules listed above”. The rules will be listed on top of the new password. After the password reset is done, the user will be taken to a page to let them know that their password has been reset. The page will include a link at the bottom that allows the user to go back to the login page. There will also be a confirmation email telling the user that their password has been reset successfully. This is to ensure security in each user’s account.

3. When a user accesses the system, they are prompted to log in. If the user logs into the administrator account they are directed to the records page. Like regular users, they can see the tabs of the records, reports, and count pages, but unlike regular users, they can see the user tab. Upon clicking this tab they are directed to the user page. On this page, the administrator can manage users. This page is split into two tabs Create User and Manage Users. In the Create User tab, the admin can create users by filling in the first name, last name, email, and password text data fields, and the role drop-down menu and pressing Create. The system will not create a user if all the data fields are not filled. In the Manage Users tab, the administrator can search for specific users by putting their email in the text data field. This lets the administrator change information by replacing information in the previously mentioned data fields on the user creation tab and clicking save or remove users by clicking a delete button next to the save button. If delete is clicked a small window will pop up to ask for confirmation on deleting said user.

4. In addition to the requirement above, when creating a user, the administrator can select what reports certain users can see. This is done by clicking the boxes next to the user’s entered information. The Reports box options consist of the six different report types the system has. After selecting what reports a user can see they click create. This will now make the system send the appropriate reports to the user’s email and let them view the specific reports on the reports page. Also, the administrator can change these permissions on the Manage Users page by selecting and deselecting the previously mentioned report-related boxes.

5. When the administrator clicks the Import/Export button on the reports page, they will be taken to the import/export dashboard. From there they would be able to go to either the import or export dashboard. Importing would be done by clicking an upload file button. Where they would be informed that the only file types the system accepts are XML and Excel spreadsheet files. As well as providing them with examples of how to format the file. Which would have to be formatted in a specific way. After clicking the upload file button, the administrator is prompted to choose a file from their computer files. After choosing the appropriate file they would then click a button named upload which will upload their new data into the system. However, before the system accepts the file, it checks if it’s in the proper format. If not the system would return an error message, telling them to check again. If the user wants to export something, they would need to return to the import/export dashboard to access the export dashboard. When they arrive at the Exporting dashboard they would be presented with multiple options. They would be able to select the report types, dates, and other options. The types of reports they could access would be daily, monthly, yearly, location, duration, and course. All of which would be displayed as buttons. From there they would be able to select from a range of dates, which would be displayed as a drop-down menu. After selecting the report, they would have the option of what to do with the report. They could preview it, download it, or email it. All of which would be displayed as buttons on the bottom of the page.

6. On the Records Page of the system, the application shall be able to record questions asked by patrons and answered by a library system. This page will feature convenient drop-down menus for Questions, Location, Time it was asked (ranging from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM), Time length of the question (categorizing it as either less than 5 minutes, between 5 to 29 minutes, or exceeding 30 minutes.) Additionally, users can input a relevant Course Code, providing an extra layer of context to the query. However, the drop-down menu for course code would only be visible depending on the category the user has selected. Afterward, users would be able to filter out the appropriate course code, by typing it out in the drop- down menu. Or they could simply select it directly if they find it easier that way. For any additional information or comments, a dedicated textbox is available for users to include supplementary details. Once all the necessary information is provided, a simple click on the ’Submit’ button securely stores the data in the database.

7. On the Records Page of the system, questions are organized into distinct categories, providing a structured approach for staff members to select the most appropriate classification. When the staff member interacts with the Question drop-down menu, they are presented with the options of General, Directions, Scanner, and Technology:
 General: This category encompasses broad queries about library resources, policies, and general information, etc.
 Directions: Designed for inquiries related to the physical layout of the library, including locating specific sections, facilities, or services, etc.
 Scanner: This option is tailored for questions concerning the use and operation of scanning equipment within the library.
 Technology: Geared towards technical inquiries, this category covers topics such as computer usage, software, and other digital resources.
This empowers the user to accurately categorize each question based on its nature. For instance, if a staff member encounters a question, they will assess its type and select the category that best describes it.

8. On the Count Page of the system (which shall be accessed through the Reports Page) Library staff shall be able to input the total number of patrons who visit the library during a given day. The number of heads counted shall be input in the Count textbox. To maintain precision, every 30 minutes, a staff member will diligently enter this data, providing a timely and accurate representation of library activity throughout the day. By regularly updating this information, the system ensures that the library stays well-informed about visitor trends.

9. Upon clicking the reports tab, the tab shall take the user to the report page. Where hyperlinked images will appear, each report should be sorted by name; those names are listed as the following: daily, monthly, yearly, courses, and the length of the question and answer period in the sessions. This data information and the question’s location will be input into the system. The reports should be able to use visuals, text, or a mixture of both. The visual model could vary from graphs, charts, and spreadsheets displaying the information from the question and answer sessions.

10. On the Reports page, there should be a drop-down menu provided. Once the user selects what type of report of their choice. The drop-down menu should allow the administrator to search reports by date. By selecting the view button the report will appear.

11. One of the reports the system should provide is a daily report. The system will generate this report once a day at 11:59 p.m. The report shall be sent to the e-mail of users as designated by the administrator. This report shall also be viewable from the Reports page. The daily report shall include the total number of questions asked on that day and the total number of patrons (traffic) counted on that day. Visually, the report will do this with a bar graph. The x-axis will be two bars, one being the total traffic count (labeled as traffic) and the other the number of questions asked (labeled as questions). The y-axis is an integer value and will be the total number of questions asked and the total number of patrons in the library. The system will get these values from the database via an SQL query that is constructed and sent on the generation of the report. The system will sort the result of the SQL query into objects and data structures to populate the values of the graph. Textually, the report will show this data by generating a table that has two columns and two rows. The first column will contain the labels, traffic, and questions. The next column will have an integer value of the total number of people in the library and the total number of questions answered on that day. The system will display this table below the visual graph on the reports page or within the body of the sent e-mail.

12. One of the reports the system should provide is a monthly report. The system will generate this report on the first day of the month once a Month. The report shall be sent to the e-mail of users as designated by the administrator. This report shall also be viewable from the Reports page. The monthly report shall show trends in the total number of questions in the past six months. The system will do this visually with a line graph. The x-axis will be six months within the given period labeled by the month’s name. The y-axis will be an integer value of the total number of questions asked within that month. The system will get these values from the database via an SQL query that is constructed and sent on the generation of the report. The system will sort the result of the SQL query into objects and data structures to populate the values of the graph. Textually, the report will show this data by generating a table that has two columns and two rows. The first column will be labeled ”Month,” and the second will be labeled ”Number of Questions.” In the column labeled ”Month,” the six months names will be listed in descending chronological order (i.e., Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun). In the column labeled ”Number of Questions,” the six numbers of total questions asked in that month will be listed in descending chronological order to match with the appropriate month. If there is no data for the past six months, the system will return only those months that the system has data recorded within that time frame. The system will display this table below the visual graph on the reports page or within the body of the sent e-mail.

13. One of the reports the system should provide is a yearly report. The system will generate this report on the first day of the new fiscal year. The report shall be sent to the e-mail of users as designated by the administrator. This report shall also be viewable from the Reports page. The yearly report shall show trends in library traffic for a given hour of the day. The system will do this visually with a line graph. The x-axis will be 13-hour labels, starting from 8:00 A.M. and ending at 8:00 P.M. The y-axis will be an integer value of the total number of persons counted at that hour within the fiscal year. The system will get these values from the database via an SQL query that is constructed and sent on the generation of the report. The system will sort the result of the SQL query into objects and data structures to populate the values of the graph. Textually, the report will show this data by generating a table that has two columns and two rows. The first column will be labeled ”Hour,” and the second will be labeled ”Total Traffic.” In the column labeled ”Hour,” the 13 hours names will be listed in descending chronological order (i.e., 8:00 A.M., 9:00 A.M., 10:00 A.M., 11:00 A.M., 12:00 P.M., 1:00 P.M., et cetera). In the column labeled ”Total Traffic,” the total number of persons counted at a given hour within the fiscal year will be ordered to match the appropriate hour. The system will display this table below the visual graph on the reports page or within the body of the sent e-mail. If viewed on the reports page, there should be two additional modeler buttons next to the column labels. By default, these will appear as a downward arrow, but if clicked, they will change to an upward-facing arrow. Whenever either of these buttons are clicked, the current active button should be highlighted to help indicate the sorting order to the user. The table will always start sorted by the hour in chronological order with arrow button next to the ”Hour” label highlighted and downwards facing. If the button next to ”Hour” label is clicked, it will change to an upward-facing position, and the table will be sorted in reverse chronological order. If clicked again, the table will return to being sorted based on chronological order and the arrow will be downward facing. If the button next to the ”Total Traffic” label is clicked, the table will be sorted from lowest to highest total count, and the button will be highlighted with a downward facing arrow. If clicked again, the arrow will change to upward facing and sort the table from highest to lowest total count and remain highlighted. All sorting will be done with any necessary data structures.

14. From the Report page, users can view analytics about the library. One of the options they could choose from would be analytics about the duration of question and answer sessions. On the Report page, it would be shown as an option titled Duration. Upon selecting to see that report, the system would prompt them to select a date from the drop-down menu. The system would then generate a report of the requested information. The report would display the information with both visual and textual elements. This type of report can also be previewed via the export report page as well.

15. From the Report page, users would be able to access the analytics of the library. One of the options they could choose from would be course-related questions. On the report page, the option would be titled Course. Upon selecting that option, the user would be prompted to select a date from the drop-down menu. Afterward, the system would generate a report of the selected information. The report would use both visual and textual elements to show the information. These types of reports can also be previewed via the export report page as well.

16. From the Report page, users would be able to access analytics about the library. One of the options they could choose from would be the locations of the question and answer sessions. On the report page, the option would be titled Location. It would show how they asked a question whether it was in person, online, or by phone. Upon selecting to see that report, the system would prompt them to select a date from the drop-down menu. The system would then generate a report of the requested information. The report would display the information with both visual and textual elements. These types of reports can also be previewed via the export report page as well.
